### ALMA - arduino-web

This is a project so that teachers who are not familiar with programming can use the Servo developed by Tufts, called: SmartMotors, in public schools in Brazil.

# Goal
Create a way to make the Smart Motors code more flexible so that it can be used by teachers (they are not programmers, but work with robotics) of public schools in Brazil.

# Kit
1. One Arduino;
2. One Servo;
3. LDR;
4. Potentiometer;
5. One Button
>Note: the connection ports can change and keep working as expected.
